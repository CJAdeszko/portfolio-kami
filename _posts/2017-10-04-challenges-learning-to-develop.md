title: Challenges While Learning to Develop
---

Unlike my previous two blog posts which were probably too wordy and shared more background information about me than anyone besides my parents would probably care to read, I plan on this post being succinct. The content of this post is about the challenges I have faced in learning development. So here they are:

### 1. Figuring out what the heck is going on

Example problems are great for trying to learn the process of development. They give you the code and tell you exactly what it is supposed to do so you can read through it and follow along. Sometimes this works great, other times these are the most ambiguous lines of code you will ever read. Due to poorly named variables, functions, and other various elements, sometimes figuring out just what exactly the code is doing can be a frustrating endeavor. You know it works. But even after reading it 148 times, you’re not really sure why. I have found that talking through what each line of code should accomplish, step by step, with my mentor to be a more beneficial way to understand what’s happening than blindly copying the code in to my program and watching it work.

### 2. Breaking tasks down into digestible pieces

Learning to code can be overwhelming. Being told to write a function that meets 8 criteria and produces a certain result can lead to almost immediate feelings of confusion and frustration if you don’t take it step by step. I am quickly learning that the best way to overcome the challenge of writing code that functions properly without suffering from information overload in the criteria is to utilize pseudocode within my program, tackling each bullet point one at a time.

### 3. Knowing when (and how long) to struggle and when to ask for help

One of my biggest challenges is knowing when to struggle and when to ask for help. Obviously, I don’t want to be the person that goes running to my mentor as soon as something goes wrong, doesn’t work, or I don’t totally grasp a concept. My problem comes in knowing just how long is an appropriate amount of time to struggle on my own. If something doesn’t work I Google it. I read the documentation on different methods that could potentially fix my problem. But how long do I spend doing this before I wave the white flag and ask my mentor? 30 minutes? An hour? Two hours? I think each situation is unique, however, when you have a timeline laid out for you and you need to keep pace, every minute not spent moving forward and making progress becomes a stressor. My challenge has been that I go down a rabbit hole searching for the answers online, when I should be reaching out to my mentor or the Bloc community for guidance.
