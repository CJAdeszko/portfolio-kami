title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Well, if you read my first post about my goals as a developer, then you know my path up to this point has been unconventional. As was discussed in that post, I graduated a semester early from high school, toured with my band, quit my band, went to community college, transferred to a university, transferred again, realized I didn’t want to be a mechanical engineer, dropped out, got a job, quit said job, moved across the country, found a new job, wanted a different job, and now I am here.

That is basically the cliff notes version of the last seven years of my life (omitting most of the good stuff, to be honest).

So when I decided that I needed to go back to school, I started looking at conventional universities. That’s what employers today are looking for, right? Your name on a piece of paper just to get your foot in the door. I was about to commit to an online program in software engineering through a traditional university when I saw a Wall Street Journal article on a Snapchat story about coding bootcamps. It wasn’t the first time I had read about coding bootcamps, but the knowledge of them was buried somewhere at the back of my mind.

So, I started looking into these bootcamps with intent. The more I read, the more it seemed like the right decision for me. I wanted to get out of my current position as soon as possible and the coding bootcamp route was going to be faster than the traditional university by a year or more. On top of that, I would get more hands on experience actually coding and building projects to showcase to potential employers than I would through a traditional university. Learning by doing has always worked better for me than sitting through monotonous lectures day after day.

I read articles and lists about the best bootcamps, development programs, cohorts, in-person, remote, etc… I spent hours on each program’s site reading about their process, their guarantees, and their curriculum and I finally narrowed it down to a few candidates. Most of the programs claim you don’t need any prior coding experience to be successful in their program, just a good work ethic and the drive to succeed. Well, having some previous ~~headaches~~ experience in programming, I decided that doing some pre-learning on my own before committing to a program seemed like the right thing to do. Especially given that it had been about six years since I had written a line of code.

So, after a couple of weeks of doing some free JavaScript tutorials online to get me back in the coding mindset, I decided to make a call to one of the companies I had been researching. I couldn’t find a totally negative review about the company anywhere online. Sure, some people had gripes about certain things. But even those individuals ultimately had something positive to say about their experience in the program. I spoke to David at Bloc and after a 30 minute conversation about my goals and previous experience, I hung up the phone to call my parents and tell them that, for the first time that I can remember, I was excited about the prospect of going back to “school”.

That was weird.

I registered with Bloc about a week later and set my start date a few weeks out. Since I already had some basic knowledge of programming, the first module of curriculum at Bloc went quickly. I felt fairly confident exiting the introduction module only to be dropkicked by reality upon starting the build of BlocJams.

Whereas I was consistently moving forward in the introduction module, the more advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript methods that started being used in BlocJams sometimes left me baffled for extended periods of time. Luckily, Bloc pairs you with a mentor for just such occasions. After hours of exhaustive Google searches, reading documentation and potential solutions online, to the point where you feel you are reading another language (which, let’s be honest, you kind of are) you can always reach out to your mentor, a proven developer in their own right.

I believe it is the mentorship that sets Bloc apart from their competitors. Weekly one-on-one meetings with a professional developer is like a dedicated tutoring session to air all of your concerns and talk through questions about the material you are covering. The curriculum at Bloc is challenging. There is no arguing that. But having a dedicated mentor to help you through the process can make the experience less painful than trying to learn software development on your own.
