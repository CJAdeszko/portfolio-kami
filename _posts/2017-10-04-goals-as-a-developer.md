title: My Goals as a Developer
---

My path to becoming a developer has not been a conventional one. My original educational and career path was in mechanical engineering. I had always had an interest in creating, building, and understanding how things worked, so, in my mind, it was a logical choice to pursue that field. One week into Thermodynamics, however, I came to the realization that spending the next four months optimizing an air conditioning unit sounded overwhelmingly mundane and considered whether continuing to pursue mechanical engineering was what I truly wanted...

I ended up leaving college and moving home within the week.

I started looking for a full-time job so that I could gain work experience and make money while considering what to do next. After doing nine months worth of work in six months time, I decided I needed a change and quit my job. A few months later, I left my home state of Illinois and moved to Arizona without a job and barely a plan of what to do when I got here. But the change was good for me.

Luckily, I found a new job relatively quickly. I could pay all of my bills and continue to live on my own in Arizona. Unfortunately, I once again found my work life to be less than satisfactory. I knew that finishing my education was important, and more than that, I wanted to finish my education. So, I started thinking about going back to school. I knew I was going to go back online so that I could continue to work full-time, but I didn’t know what I wanted to go back for. I didn’t want to start over from square one, so I started looking into fields related to mechanical engineering so that most of my credits would transfer. Having taken a couple of courses in programming during my engineering curriculum, I knew that there were aspects of software engineering and development that I enjoyed despite the sometimes overwhelming frustration that comes with the territory. I decided to pursue software engineering.

If you’ve made it this far into the post, you’re probably thinking to yourself, “What the hell does any of this have to do with your goals as a developer? I don’t need to hear your life story.” Fair enough. I would be asking myself the same question if I ever ventured to read a blog. But I write all of this because I am an honest person and my goals as a developer, first and foremost, are to improve my life. I want to make more money, have better job security and more job satisfaction, and be afforded more opportunities than I see possible in my current position. And I know that a career in technology is the way to achieve these things. So there you have it.

Goal #1 as a developer: Improve my life.

This isn’t necessarily the politically correct interview answer you may have been expecting, but it’s an honest one.

Beyond my top priority, my goals are what you might have expected to hear… I look around the world today and think about the future that I’ve seen in movies and TV. Weren’t we supposed to have flying cars by now?

In a world that is becoming increasingly reliant on technology, I want to be able to help move us toward the future we were told we would have. The idea of automating everyday tasks intrigues me. I have seen concept videos for an Ikea kitchen with touch screens that can display a recipe for you to follow or even make the meal itself. Tesla has laid the framework for completely autonomous vehicles that can be attainable for the average person. These are the types of projects that I want to work on as a developer.

Undoubtedly, the gap between engineering applications of software development and web development is vast. But you have to start somewhere. That is why they are called goals.
